I shall commit my thoughts\\r\\n\\n\\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\\r\\n\\n\\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\\r\\n\\n\\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\\r\\n\\n\\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\\r\\n\\n\\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\\r\\n\\n\\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\\r\\n\\n\\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\\r\\n\\n\\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\\r\\n\\n\\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomasâ€™ books of voyages.\\r\\n\\n\\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\\r\\n\\n\\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\\r\\n\\n\\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\\r\\n\\n\\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\\r\\n\\n\\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\\r\\n\\n\\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\\r\\n\\n\\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\\r\\n\\n\\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\\r\\n\\n\\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\\r\\n\\n\\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\\r\\n\\n\\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\\r\\n\\n\\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\\r\\n\\n\\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\\r\\n\\n\\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\\r\\n\\n\\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\\r\\n\\n\\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\\r\\n\\n\\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\\r\\n\\n\\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\\r\\n\\n\\nin my enterprise.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/84/pg84.txt'})"

       "\"\\nThe narrator, writing from St. Petersburg, informs his sister that he has arrived safely and is confident in the success of his undertaking. He is the author of the novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. He is inspired by the cold northern breeze and his daydreams of discovering a land of beauty and delight beyond the pole. He has dedicated himself to this great enterprise by inuring his body to hardship, accompanying whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea, and voluntarily enduring cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep. He has twice hired himself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler and is now preparing to depart for Archangel in a fortnight or three weeks to hire a ship and engage sailors for his voyage. He has secured the services of a master of an excellent disposition and remarkable gentleness and mildness of discipline, whom he heard of in a romantic manner from a lady who owes him the happiness of her life. He hopes to discover the wondrous power that attracts the needle and to regulate celestial observations, and to confer an inestimable benefit on all mankind by discovering a passage near the pole. He expresses his loneliness and lack of companionship, and mentions his lieutenant, an Englishman of great courage and enterprise, whom he met on board a whale vessel and has since employed to assist in his enterprise. He is filled with a passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of the ocean and is determined to explore the untamed yet obedient element. He is prepared to face the dangers of the voyage and is hopeful of success, despite the potential risks. After being surrounded by ice and a thick fog, the narrator and his crew witness a strange sight of a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north.

    "> The narrator, writing from St. Petersburg, informs his sister that he has arrived safely and is confident in the success of his undertaking. He is the author of the novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. He is inspired by the cold northern breeze and his daydreams of discovering a land of beauty and delight beyond the pole. He has dedicated himself to this great enterprise by inuring his body to hardship, accompanying whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea, and voluntarily enduring cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep. He has twice hired himself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler and is now preparing to depart for Archangel in a fortnight or three weeks to hire a ship and engage sailors for his voyage. He has secured the services of a master of an excellent disposition and remarkable gentleness and mildness of discipline, whom he heard of in a romantic manner from a lady who owes him the happiness of her life. He hopes to discover the wondrous power that attracts the needle and to regulate celestial observations, and to confer an inestimable benefit on all mankind by discovering a passage near the pole. He expresses his loneliness and lack of companionship, and mentions his lieutenant, an Englishman of great courage and enterprise, whom he met on board a whale vessel and has since employed to assist in his enterprise. He is filled with a passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of the ocean and is determined to explore the untamed yet obedient element.
